## Assignment 9 - View Optimization / Fit Mesh

In this assignment, the idea is to practice operations with differentiable rendering using the PyTorch3D to optimize meshes and scene parameters from multiple viewpoints. The code of this assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/lquatrin/i3d21/blob/main/code/a9/Assignment9.ipynb).

### Rendering pipeline and discontinuity issues

A rendering pipeline is used to generate 2d images from 3d scenes, where the scene is defined by 3d objects represented by vertices, lines and polygons. It wants to project the current scene onto the image plane defined by a camera in a 3D environment. To do that, the camera first transforms each 3D object from world to view coordinates, which can be seem as a change of basis, considering the camera positioned at (0,0,0) and directed along the z direction (being positive or negative depending on the convention). Then, a projection matrix (also given by the camera) projects the triangles onto the image plane, which is considered the xy-plane, defining the color of each pixel by taking the nearest face. A camera also defines which objects will be shown, and which objects will be discarded, when they do not influence the rendered image.

According to [1], there are two steps that are not differentiable in rendering. First, the z discontinuity, which happens when two triangles are close in terms of depth, then a small change in its vertices may cause them to overlap. The overlap causes a discontinuity since it causes a step change in pixel color when the nearest face changes. There is also a second discontinuty problem caused by changing the position of a triangle in screen space. In this case, a step change in pixel color is caused due to face boundaries.

In PyTorch3D, they used a soft rasterizer [2] to solve these problems. The problem of z discontinuity is solved by soft aggregating the K nearest faces. The second discontinuity problem was solved by decaying each faceâ€™s influence toward its boundary. It is important to notice that PyTorch3D is implemented based on each face that intersects the camera's image plane, instead of considering only each pixel, since the face blending have to be calculated.
